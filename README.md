  ## Installation
    Navigate to https://github.com/robinsonfdossantos/README-Creator.

    Open a local built-in Terminal (Powershell, Bash) on your local machine.

    Navigate to a desired folder to place your project in, using 'cd "folder"'.

    Use 'git clone' to copy the repository to your local computer by typing "git clone git@github.com:robinsonfdossantos/README-Creator.git".

  ## Usage

    Run the program using the terminal built into VS Code.

    Answer the questions prompted to complete your README file.

    When answering the questions, if you want to create a new paragraph, instead of typing 'Enter', use the command '/n/n' to go to the next paragraph in the same section.

    If you type 'Enter' by mistake and skip to the next question, don't worry, later you can access your README file and edit it before uploading it to your repository.

    After you finish answering all the questions, a file called README.md will appear for you, so you can copy the file into your personal project.
